Sharding is the process of breaking up large tables into smaller chunks called shards that are spread across multiple servers.

When dividing a data store up into shards, decide which data should be placed in each shard. 
A shard typically contains items that fall within a specified range determined by one or more attributes of the data. 
These attributes form the shard key (sometimes referred to as the partition key). 
The shard key should be static. It shouldn't be based on data that might change.

Three strategies are commonly used when selecting the shard key and deciding how to distribute data across shards.

1. The Lookup strategy. In this strategy the sharding logic implements a map that routes a request for data to the shard 
that contains that data using the shard key. 
In a multi-tenant application all the data for a tenant might be stored together in a shard using the tenant ID as the shard key. 
Multiple tenants might share the same shard, but the data for a single tenant won't be spread across multiple shards.

2. The Range strategy.

3. The Hash strategy.
