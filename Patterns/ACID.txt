ACID is an acronym that helps to remember the fundamental principles of a transnational system. 
ACID stands for Atomic, Consistent, Isolation, and Durability.  Here are some informal definitions:


--Atomicicty

Transaction acting on several pieces of information complete only if all pieces successfully save.   
Here, “all or nothing” applies to the transaction

--Consistentency (correct)

Consistency ensures that a transaction can only bring the database from one valid state to another, 
maintaining database invariants: any data written to the database must be valid according to all defined rules, 
including constraints, cascades, triggers

--Isolation

Any reads or writes performed on the database will not be impacted by other reads and writes of separate transactions 
occurring on the same database.

--Durability

Durability ensures that changes made to the database (transactions) that are successfully committed will survive permanently, 
even in the case of system failures.
Durability is achieved through the use of changelogs
