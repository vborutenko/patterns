Synchronization Context is the environment that a thread runs in

No thread can access another thread’s data or pass any unit of work to the other thread without communicating
through the target thread’s synchronization context


One of the core concepts of synchronization context is context switching. It is what happens when you await a task.
You capture the current context before awaiting the task, leaving it to the task context,
then recovering (re-entering) it back when the task completes.
