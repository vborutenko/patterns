Boxing is the process of converting a value type to the type object or to any interface type implemented by this value type. 
When the common language runtime (CLR) boxes a value type, it wraps the value inside a System.Object instance and stores it on the managed heap. 

Unboxing extracts the value type from the object. Boxing is implicit; unboxing is explicit. 
The concept of boxing and unboxing underlies the C# unified view of the type system in which a value of any type can be treated as an object.
