The heart of .NET Framework is a run-time environment called the common language runtime (CLR). 
The CLR manages the life cycle and executes .NET applications (code). 
It also provides services that make the development process easier. 


The CLR provides additional services including 
memory management, 
type safety, 
exception handling, 
garbage collection, 
security and thread management.
