1. Dirty Reads
One transaction is allowed to read the uncommitted data of another transaction
2. Lost Update
The Lost Update Concurrency Problem happens in SQL Server when two or more transactions are allowed to read and update the same data.
(Select value than value++ than update)
3. Non-Repeatable Read
one transaction reads the same data twice while another transaction updates that data 
in between the first and second read of the first transaction. (see image)
4. Phantom Read
One transaction executes a query twice and it gets a different number of rows in the result set each time(see image)
