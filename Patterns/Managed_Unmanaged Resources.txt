Managed resources basically means "managed memory" that is managed by the garbage collector. 
When you no longer have any references to a managed object (which uses managed memory), 
the garbage collector will (eventually) release that memory for you.

Unmanaged resources are then everything that the garbage collector does not know about. For example:

-Open files
-Open network connections
-Unmanaged memory
-In XNA: vertex buffers, index buffers, textures, etc.
