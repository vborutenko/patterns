Optimistic Locking is a strategy where you read a record, 
take note of a version number (other methods to do this involve dates, timestamps or checksums/hashes) 
and check that the version hasn't changed before you write the record back. 
When you write the record back you filter the update on the version to make sure it's atomic. 
(i.e. hasn't been updated between when you check the version and write the record to the disk) and update the version in one hit.


Pessimistic Locking is when you lock the record for your exclusive use until you have finished with it
