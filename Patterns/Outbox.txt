Simply, when your API publishes event messages, it doesn’t directly send them. 
Instead, the messages are persisted in a database table. 
After that, A job publish events to message broker system in predefined time intervals.

In example, when a new product is added to the system, the process of adding the product and writing 
the ProductCreated event to the outbox table is done in the same transaction, 
ensuring that the event is saved to the database.

The second step is to receive these events written to the outbox table by an independent service and write them to the event bus.

Why we use this Outbox Pattern ?

 the database update and sending of the message should be atomic
