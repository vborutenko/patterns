---Service Oriented Architecture

Service Oriented Architecture is a software architecture, where distinct components of the application provide services 
to other components via a communications protocol over a network. 
The communication can involve either simple data passing or it could involve two or more services coordinating 
connecting services to each other. These distinct services carry out some small functions, such as validating payment, 
creating a user account, or providing social log-in.

Service-oriented Architecture is less about how to modularize an application, and more about how to compose an application 
by integration of distributed, separately-maintained and deployed software components.

There are 2 main roles in SOA, a service provider, and a service consumer

 Every service is communicating through the ESB (enterprise service bus)

 the main difference between SOA and microservices lies in the size and scope. 
 The prefix “micro” in microservices refers to the granularity of the internal components, 
 meaning they have to be significantly smaller than what SOA tends to be. 
 Service components within microservices generally have a single purpose and they do that one thing really well. 
 On the other hand, in SOA services usually include much more business functionality,



---Microservices
Microservices, in a way, are the next step in the evolution of Service-Oriented Architectures. Basically, 
this architecture type is a particular way of developing software, 
web or mobile applications as suites of independent services — a.k.a microservices. 
These services are created to serve only one specific business function, such as User Management, User Roles, 
E-commerce Cart, Search Engine, Social Media Logins etc
