In stack data can be added to and deleted only from the top of it.
In heap data can be stored and removed in any order.


The stack is always reserved in a LIFO (last in first out) order


In a multi-threaded application, each thread will have its own stack. But, all the different threads will share the heap

The stack is much faster than the heap. This is because of the way that memory is allocated on the stack. 
Allocating memory on the stack is as simple as moving the stack pointer up.


Data on the stack is automatically deallocated when variables go out of scope
