Middleware is software that's assembled into an app pipeline to handle requests and responses

Request delegates are configured using Run, Map, and Use extension methods

When a delegate doesn't pass a request to the next delegate, 
it's called short-circuiting the request pipeline.

app.Use(async (context, next) =>
{
    // Do work that can write to the Response.
    await next.Invoke();
    // Do logging or other work that doesn't write to the Response.
});

app.Run(async context =>
{
    await context.Response.WriteAsync("Hello from 2nd delegate.");
});
